Converts Python files(.py) to Ren'Py files(.rpy).

.rpy files generated by this script are identical to the .py files, except for all the code being placed inside a Ren'Py "init python" block.


Usage
-----

From the command line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When called from the command line, multiple files can be specified at once, each separated by a space.
The file extension should be omitted.

.. code-block::

    python py_to_rpy.py file1 file2 file3

By default, new .rpy files are created next to the .py files.
However, the dest argument can be used to place them into a new folder.

.. code-block::

    python py_to_rpy.py file1 file2 file3 --dest my_folder
