Converts Python files(.py) to Ren'Py files(.rpy).

.rpy files generated by this script are identical to the .py files, except for all the code being placed inside a Ren'Py "init python" block.


Usage
-----

From the command line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When called from the command line, multiple files can be specified at once, each separated by a space.
The file extension should be omitted.

.. code-block:: console

    python py_to_rpy.py file1 file2 file3

Into a specific destination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
By default, new .rpy files are created next to the .py files.
However, the --dest argument can be used to place them into a new folder.

.. code-block:: console

    python py_to_rpy.py file1 file2 file3 --dest=my_folder

Strict Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~
    
By default, new .rpy files will preserve renpy imports that were in the .py file. However, these imports are normally unnecessary in .rpy files.
To strip them out, use the --strict flag.

.. code-block:: console

    python py_to_rpy.py file1 file2 file3 --strict

The following imports are stripped: 

`import renpy.exports as renpy`

`from renpy.{module} import {class}`

Ignoring specific lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there are specific lines you want strict mode to ignore, they can be specified in py_to_rpy.json.

.. code-block:: console

    {
        "ignore": ["from renpy.python import RevertableList"]
    }
